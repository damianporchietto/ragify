SOURDOUGH BREAD RECIPE

Ingredients:
- 500g bread flour
- 350g water
- 100g active sourdough starter
- 10g salt

Instructions:

1. Mix and Autolyse:
   Combine flour and water in a large bowl. Mix until no dry flour remains. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

2. Add Starter and Salt:
   Add your active starter and salt to the dough. Mix thoroughly by pinching and folding the dough until well incorporated.

3. Bulk Fermentation:
   Cover the dough and let it rise at room temperature (70-75°F) for 4-6 hours. During this time, perform 4-6 sets of stretch and folds spaced 30 minutes apart.

4. Pre-shape:
   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape into a round and let rest for 15-20 minutes.

5. Final Shape:
   Shape the dough into a tight ball or batard. Place in a floured banneton or bowl lined with a floured kitchen towel, seam side up.

6. Final Proof:
   Cover and refrigerate for 12-15 hours (overnight).

7. Bake:
   Preheat oven with a Dutch oven inside to 500°F (260°C). Turn the dough out onto parchment paper, score the top, and place in the Dutch oven. Bake covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered at 450°F (230°C) for another 20-25 minutes until deep golden brown.

8. Cool:
   Allow the bread to cool completely on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.

Tips:
- A ripe sourdough starter should double in size 4-8 hours after feeding
- Dough is ready for shaping when it's puffy and has increased in volume by about 50%
- The longer the cold proof, the more sour flavor will develop
